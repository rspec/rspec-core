Feature: Zero monkey patching mode

  Use the `disable_monkey_patching!` configuration option to
  disable all monkey patching done by RSpec:

  - stops exposing DSL globally
  - disables `should` and `should_not` syntax for rspec-expectations
  - disables `stub`, `should_receive`, and `should_not_receive` syntax for
    rspec-mocks

  ```ruby
  RSpec.configure { |c| c.disable_monkey_patching! }
  ```
