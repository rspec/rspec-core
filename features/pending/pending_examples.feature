Feature: pending examples

  RSpec offers four ways to indicate that an example is disabled pending
  some action.

  Scenario: pending implementation
    Given a file named "example_without_block_spec.rb" with:
      """
      describe "an example" do
        it "is a pending example"
      end
      """
    When I run "rspec example_without_block_spec.rb"
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain "1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending"
    And the output should contain "Not Yet Implemented"
    And the output should contain "example_without_block_spec.rb:2"

  Scenario: pending any arbitary reason, with no block
    Given a file named "pending_without_block_spec.rb" with:
      """
      describe "an example" do
        it "is implemented but waiting" do
          pending("something else getting finished")
          this_should_not_get_executed
        end
      end
      """
    When I run "rspec pending_without_block_spec.rb"
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain "1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending"
    And the output should contain:
      """
      Pending:
        an example is implemented but waiting
          # something else getting finished
          # ./pending_without_block_spec.rb:2
      """

  Scenario: pending any arbitary reason, with a block that fails

    Given a file named "pending_with_passing_block_spec.rb" with:
      """
      describe "an example" do
        it "is implemented but waiting" do

    And the output should contain "Expected pending 'something else getting finished' to fail. No Error was raised."
    And the output should contain "pending_with_passing_block_spec.rb:3"

  Scenario: temporarily pending by changing "it" to "xit"
    Given a file named "pending_with_xit_spec.rb" with:
      """
      describe "an example" do
        xit "is pending using xit" do
