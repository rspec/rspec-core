Feature: configure expectation framework

  By default, RSpec is configured to include rspec-expectations for expressing
  desired outcomes. You can also configure RSpec to use:

  * rspec/expectations (explicitly)
  * stdlib assertions
    * test/unit assertions in ruby 1.8
    * minitest assertions in ruby 1.9
  * rspec/expecations _and_ stlib assertions
